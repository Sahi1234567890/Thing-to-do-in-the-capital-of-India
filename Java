<div style="border: 2px solid black"> HOW CONSTITUTION GOVERNS THE ALLOCATION OF POWER IN SOCIETY?</div>
<p style=color:black;> <b>Answer:</b> Any political party which forms government in the centre has certain social, political and economic responsibilities. In countries with deep cultural, religious and economic diversity such as India, it is extremely important for the government to allocate resources wisely. Various factors such as uplifting underprivileged sections of the society, facilitating financial inclusion, mitigating regional disparity, upgrading defence capabilities, providing proper educational facilities, and much more need to be focused on. Therefore, a well-planned budget is of utmost importance for any government to ensure economic stability and growth. </p>

<div style="border: 2px solid black"> WHAT WAS THE WAY IN WHICH THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA WAS MADE?</div>
<p style=color:black;> <b>Answer</B> The Constitution of India is the supreme law of India.The document lays down the framework that demarcates fundamental political code, structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and the duties of citizens. It is the longest written constitution of any country.

<p style=color:black;> It imparts constitutional supremacy (not parliamentary supremacy, since it was created by a constituent assembly rather than Parliament) and was adopted by its people with a declaration in its preamble.Parliament cannot override the constitution.It was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949 and became effective on  <mark>26 January 1950</mark> .The constitution replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as the country's fundamental governing document, and the Dominion of India became the Republic of India. To ensure constitutional autochthony, its framers repealed prior acts of the British parliament in Article 395.India celebrates its constitution on 26 January as Republic Day.
<p style=color:#373A36;> <b>The constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular,and democratic republic, assures its citizens justice, equality and liberty, and endeavours to promote fraternity.The original 1950 constitution is preserved in a helium-filled case at the Parliament House in New Delhi. The words "secular" and "socialist" were added to the preamble by 42nd amendment act in 1976, during the Emergency. </b> </p>
